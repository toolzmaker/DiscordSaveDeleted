You need browser addon for userscripts to work: Tampermonkey (Chrome) or Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Violentmonkey.<br/><br/>

Watches every deleted message in every discord-channel you have opened, and saves them to your browser localStorage<br/>(it lasts even after reboot).<br/>

Trashcan icon with an arrow in the right upper corner of Discord window opens Deleted messages list. It contains a list of deleted messages of active channel<br/>
To resize that window move your cursor to the right bottom corner of it.<br/>

To record several channels, just open a new browser tab with needed channel and make sure this script is working.<br/>
You can switch between channels and every channel will show its deleted messages storage.<br/>
You can delete every message from memory by clicking [X] button.<br/>
Make sure you enabled auto-update in your userscript settings, so you can get later versions.<br/><br/>
